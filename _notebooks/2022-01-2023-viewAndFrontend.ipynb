    "- Anything in includes will be found directly...don't need file extension when referencing a document\n",
    "- Design is more important, don't worry about backend for the week...the better the design, the happier Mortensen will be\n",
    "- _site directory --> assemble things to be ready for the web\n",
    "    - That's why there is an index.md and an index.html...html is more ready for the web than md\n",
    "- Every page you render is an html file...anything else is just a coder helper to build a bigger html file\n",
    "- Make a bunch of fragments to create a website...html is static but has stuff like uh action buttons to make it seem alive\n",
    "- He's talking about the database thing from last year now :sob:\n",
    "    - Make a CRUD table based on the project --> doesn't have to be a table, can be a for\n",
    "    - We have to use HTML5 --> has to do with the types...makes it more convenient for us --> prevents input from being incorrect through filtering input (good idea is to look at different inputs for HTML5)\n",
    "- Don't need to wait for a functioning database to do other parts of the code"
