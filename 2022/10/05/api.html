Please don&#39;t scroll down.\r\nI&#39;m 24 years old. I had a pretty normal life. My father passed away when I was in 4th standard. My mom is always there for me. She helped me a lot. Now, I&#39;m way past the time to get a job. My mom is pressuring me. I have failed my college, I couldn&#39;t pass the failed subjects. All my friends are successful and I got left out, which is my fault. I failed because I took the physics to major and I&#39;m not at all good in maths. Everyone says to finish it. I don&#39;t want to because I feel like a loser. Mom is forcing me to get a government job(I&#39;m from India, it&#39;s a big thing here). Im trying to get a job, but nothing is working out. I always feel like I&#39;m going to die. I don&#39;t think my mom will support me in getting therapy. I&#39;m living with her. She says a job is necessary to get married. I&#39;m horny and hungry when I am at home. Sometimes I get so sad, I feel like I don&#39;t exist at all. This is not a rant. Still living with mom and trying to pass an exam for government jobs.&#34;,&#34;prediction&#34;:&#34;Type 2&#34;,&#34;score&#34;:&#34;93.70%&#34;,&#34;diagnosis&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#39;, &#39;Major Depressive Disorder&#39;, &#39;Hypomania&#39;, &#39;Adjustment Disorder&#39;, &#39;Bipolar Disorder&#39;]&#34;,&#34;stressor&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Work Stress&#39;, &#39;Companionship Issues&#39;]&#34;,&#34;symptom&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Anxiety&#39;, &#39;Helplessness&#39;, &#39;Emptiness&#39;, &#39;Loss of Motivation&#39;, &#39;Anhedonia (Loss of Passion)&#39;, &#39;Fatigue&#39;, &#39;Isolation&#39;, &#39;Attachment Issues&#39;]&#34;},{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;f047eb4a-7a85-42de-8a32-737df409de7a&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;How I Tricked Myself Into Taking Care of Myself\r\nBasically, I tricked myself into taking care of myself by taking care of other things. In undergrad I had a betta fish, and now in my apartment I have houseplants. And I mean I have over 40 of them. When I get super depressed, the first things to go are personal hygiene and eating, and it takes me about an hour to decide if I want to get out of bed or not, and if I even can. But! Can&#39;t stay in bed because I don&#39;t want my plants to die! Couldn&#39;t stay in bed because I had to get up and clean my fish tank and feed her! And once I&#39;m out of bed, I guess I can make myself brush my teeth and try to eat something small. Maybe I can make a coffee and I can go out and sit on my balcony for a while. Maybe I can even shower and clean a little.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not saying this will work for everyone, but it&#39;s been a pretty decent help for me :)&#34;,&#34;prediction&#34;:&#34;Type 2&#34;,&#34;score&#34;:&#34;99.79%&#34;,&#34;diagnosis&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#39;, &#39;Major Depressive Disorder&#39;, &#39;Hypomania&#39;, &#39;Adjustment Disorder&#39;, &#39;Bipolar Disorder&#39;]&#34;,&#34;stressor&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Work Stress&#39;, &#39;Companionship Issues&#39;]&#34;,&#34;symptom&#34;:&#34;[&#39;Anxiety&#39;, &#39;Helplessness&#39;, &#39;Emptiness&#39;, &#39;Loss of Motivation&#39;, &#39;Anhedonia (Loss of Passion)&#39;, &#39;Fatigue&#39;, &#39;Isolation&#39;, &#39;Attachment Issues&#39;]&#34;}]}
